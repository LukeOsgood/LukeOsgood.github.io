            <h2>Education</h2>
            <p><strong>University of Denver, Daniels College of Business</strong></p>
            <p>Bachelor of Science Business Administration – Business Information and Analytics, June 2026</p>
            <p>I plan on taking advantage of the <a href="https://daniels.du.edu/undergraduate-programs/four-plus-one/" target="_blank">4+1 program</a> here at the University of Denver, getting my masters degree in Management in the coming years!</p>
            <h4>Relevant Coursework</h4>
            <p>A recent class that I took at the University of Denver called Informations of Information Management (INFO 3140), taught me how to code in SQL and navigate Microsoft Access.</p>
            <p>In this class, I created a fictional company and uploaded a mass amount of randomly generated data. I then created a Microsoft Access database, drawing important connections from each data table with the correct relationships. I answered important business questions such as which customers purchased the most products or what equipment costs were greater than $200? I organized all this in an extremely visually pleasing way.</p>
            <img src="Files/info 3140 exmaple.PNG" alt="Example of Access Database" width="85%">
            <p>Overall, I learned many important analytic technical skills, as well as a greater understanding in business databases.</p>

            <h2>Madden Challenge</h2>
            <p>In the fall of 2022, me and a group of four other like minded individuals embarked on a journey with a goal of creating a product utilizing artificial intelligence and IOT (the internet of things) such as augmented reality, blockchain technology, ect.</p>
            <p>My group introduced a wellness ring called “Ping” that optimized productivity and sleep routines through tailored suggestions received from an application on a mobile device. My main roles as a team member was to provide overarching conceptual ideas, create a website promoting the product and settle team disputes.</p>
            <p>Throughout our experience, we encountered many speed bumps, such as website domain issues, bluetooth capability and application user-interface. We easily navigated these challenges by communicating as a team, conferring with supervisors and learning coding practices.</p>

            <h2>Interests</h2>
            <p>I love spending time outdoors. I enjoy everything from skiing, to hiking and running. Just recently I had the pleasure of running the “That Dam Run 2025” half marathon with some of my friends in Cherry Creek in Colorado, coming in 2nd place in my age group! Below is a photo of my friends and I after the race.</p>
